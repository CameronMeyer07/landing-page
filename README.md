Taking on this task is quite daunting when you have only been doing The Odin Project for
two weeks. All the information seems quite overwhelming. 
I've been struggling with flexbox for a while. However I'm slowly starting to grasp the concepts.

I spent just over 3 hours on the "hero" section of this landing page.
Struggling to figure out where to start as well as how to position content.
I spent 2 hours on the first attempt at the "hero" section. I was unhappy and started over completely.

As time went on, I started feeling better about how I'm progressing and using the structure of html and dressing it with css.

The information part of the landing page came along a bit smoother as I referenced back to some material more often to ensure I do things right.

The inspirational quote section went along smoother than the rest of the landing page so far. It came together quite well. Although improvements can be made as time goes on.

The last section of the page seemed to become slightly easier as I have been working will all the different elements for a little while. Becoming more familiar with the aspects thereof.
